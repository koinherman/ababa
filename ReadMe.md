## ❯ Getting Started
### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.
Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Then setup your application environment.
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```
> This installs all dependencies with npm. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Running in dev mode(backend)
- Run `npm run start:dev` to start nodemon with tcs-watch, to serve the app.
- Run `npm test` to unit test for the frontend and backend.
- Run `npm format` to do prettier formation.
- Frontend server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`
